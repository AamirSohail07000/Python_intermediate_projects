Weather App üå¶Ô∏è
A Python-based weather application built with Tkinter that fetches real-time weather data from the WeatherAPI. The app allows users to select a city and displays current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and an icon representing the weather. The project includes error handling for invalid inputs and network issues, making it a reliable tool for checking the weather.

Key features:

Fetches live weather data using the WeatherAPI.
Displays weather conditions with a user-friendly GUI.
Handles errors gracefully, including invalid city names and network problems.
Includes an option to package the app as an executable for easy distribution.
